    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 fully cooked, bone-in ham</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cup dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/3 cup pineapple juice</li>
        <li>2 tbs Dijon mustard </li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground cloves</li>
        <l1>1 1/2 tbs lemon juice</l1>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place ham on a rack set in a roasting pan.</li>

        <li>Bake uncovered in the preheated oven for 2 hours.</li>

        <li>While the ham is baking, combine brown sugar, pineapple juice, and 1/3 cup honey in a saucepan. 
            Zest orange into the saucepan, then squeeze in the juice. Add Dijon mustard and ground cloves; 
            whisk mixture over medium-high heat as it comes to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until glaze thickens slightly, 
            5 to 10 minutes.</li>

        <li>Taste glaze and adjust seasonings. Add lemon juice for more tang, or honey to make it sweeter. Set aside.</li>

        <li>Remove ham from the oven after it has baked for 2 hours. Brush with glaze. Bake for an additional 30 to 45 minutes, 
            brushing ham with glaze every 10 minutes.</li>

        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
